# ReactionTime

This is a small JavaFX program that is supposed to be used to test people's reaction time
You press and hold on the red button and when it turns green, release. It will show
you your reaction time (from System.currentTimeMillis()) and keep track of previous attempts

### Known Bugs
Occasionally the RELEASE! screen comes up after clicking and releasing once but not when
holding the mouse button. I do not yet know why exactly this is happening and I
am trying to resolve it.
